**Data sources:

- (libraries like d3-tip or SQLite) that you need to implement certain features. Include the names, and if the component is not standard, include a link to its website.

**Review related visualizations:

in terms of features and technical aspects: what do they do? how have they implemented it? can you do it in the same way?
